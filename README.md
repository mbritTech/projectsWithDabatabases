### In this repo you can discover some projects developed during my finals for the Web Developer's Advanced Technician course.
----------

#### The tools that I mainly use are:
- PHP pure for the code
- MySql for the database.
- Visual Studio Code

#### If you what to test these projects in your PC you have to follow these easy steps:
1. Create an apache virtualhost for every project, the name of the virtualhost is in constansts.php in the app/Config directory.
2. Active the site with a2ensite configfile.conf.
3. Add the virtualhost to the /etc/hosts file.
4. Enjoy!
